Home Assistant Goldair WiFi Fan component
============================================

The `goldair_heater` component integrates 
[Goldair WiFi-enabled heaters](http://www.goldair.co.nz/product-catalogue/heating/wifi-heaters) into Home Assistant, 
enabling control of setting the following parameters via the UI and the following services:

**Climate**
* **power** (on/off)
* **mode** (Comfort, Eco, Anti-freeze)
* **target temperature** (`5`-`35` in Comfort mode, `5`-`21` in Eco mode, in °C)
* **power level** (via the swing mode setting because no appropriate HA option exists: `Auto`, `1`-`5`, `Stop`)

Current temperature is also displayed.

**Sensor**
* **current temperature** (in °C)

**Light**
* **LED display** (on/off)

**Lock**
* **Child lock** (on/off)

---

### Warning
Please note, this component has currently only been tested with the Goldair GPPH (inverter) range, however theoretically 
it should also work with GEPH and GPCV devices and any other Goldair heaters based on the Tuya platform.

---

To enable the component, copy the contents of this repository's `component` directory to your
`<config_dir>/custom_components` directory, then add the following lines to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
goldair_heater:
  - name: My heater
    host: 1.2.3.4
    device_id: <your device id>
    local_key: <your local key>
```

CONFIGURATION VARIABLES
-----------------------

### name
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*(string) (Required)* Any unique for the device; required because the Tuya API doesn't provide
                                              the one you set in the app.

### host
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*(string) (Required)* IP or hostname of the device.

### device_id
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*(string) (Required)* Device ID retrieved from the Goldair app logs (see below).

### local_key
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*(string) (Required)* Local key retrieved from the Goldair app logs (see below).

### climate
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*(boolean) (Optional)* Whether to surface this heater as a climate device.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*Default value: true* 

### sensor
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*(boolean) (Optional)* Whether to surface this heater's thermometer as a temperature sensor.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*Default value: false* 

### display_light
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*(boolean) (Optional)* Whether to surface this heater's LED display control as a light.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*Default value: false* 

### child_lock
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*(boolean) (Optional)* Whether to surface this heater's child lock as a lock device.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*Default value: false* 

GOTCHAS
-------
These heaters have individual target temperatures for their Comfort and Eco modes, whereas Home Assistant only supports
a single target temperature. Therefore, when you're in Comfort mode you will set the Comfort temperature (`5`-`35`), and
when you're in Eco mode you will set the Eco temperature (`5`-`21`), just like you were using the heater's own control 
panel. Bear this in mind when writing automations that change the operation mode and set a temperature at the same time: 
you must change the operation mode *before* setting the new target temperature, otherwise you will set the current 
thermostat rather than the new one. 

When switching to Anti-freeze mode, the heater will set the current power level to `1` as if you had manually chosen it.
When you switch back to other modes, you will no longer be in `Auto` and will have to set it again if this is what you
wanted. This could be worked around in code however it would require storing state that may be cleared if HA is
restarted and due to this unreliability it's probably best that you just factor it into your automations.

When child lock is enabled, the heater's display will flash with the child lock symbol (`[]`) whenever you change
something in HA. This can be confusing because it's the same behaviour as when you try to change something via the
heater's own control panel and the change is rejected due to being locked, however rest assured that the changes *are* 
taking effect.

FINDING YOUR DEVICE ID AND LOCAL KEY
------------------------------------

If you have an Android device that supports Mass Storage mode, you can easily find these properties using the below 
instructions. If you don't, there are some alternate methods at 
[codetheweb/tuyapi](https://github.com/codetheweb/tuyapi/blob/master/docs/SETUP.md) (you're looking for the `uuid` and
`localKey` values).

1. Download the [Goldair app from the Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.goldair.smart).
2. Follow the instructions in the app to set up the heater. Don't agonise over the name because you'll be giving it a 
   new one in HA, but do remember it because you'll use this name to find the keys later.
3. Once this is done and you've verified that you can control the heater from your phone, close the app and plug your 
   phone into a computer in Mass Storage mode (choose the option to browse files). 
    * ℹ Alternatively you can use an Android file browser, but bear in mind you will need to search through a large log
        file
4. Browse your phone's filesystem to find `/Android/data/com.goldair.smart/cache/1.abj` and open it in a text editor 
   that can handle large files.
5. Search for your device in this file by the name you gave it earlier. You're looking for a very long line that 
   contains not only the device name, but also `uuid` and `localKey` properties. 
    * ℹ If you've been using the app a while and have added this device more than once, you need to find the last 
        occurrence of this kind of line for your device in the log file
6. Copy the value of `uuid` (eg: 1234567890abcdef1234) to `device_id`, and the value of `localKey` 
   (eg: 1234567890abcdef) to `local_key` in your `configuration.yaml` file.

Repeat for as many heaters as you have to set up.

NEXT STEPS
----------
This component needs specs! Once they're written I'm considering submitting it to the HA team for inclusion in standard 
installations. Please report any issues and feel free to raise pull requests.

This was my first Python project, so feel free to correct any conventions or idioms I got wrong.
